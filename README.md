# JavaScript Practice

This purpose of this application is to take an array of names and then output either Hello + "name" or Good Bye + "name" to the console. The console will output "Good Bye" along with any name that begins with the letter "J", uppercase or lowercase.  The console will output "Hello" only with names that do not begin with the letter "J".  The JS code contains the usual objects, variables, functions, for loops, and if/else statements along with some IIFE's.  This application primarily uses JavaScript along with HTML5.
